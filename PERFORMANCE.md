# Performance Optimizations Documentation

This document outlines all the performance optimizations implemented in the Solar Fusion website to improve SEO and user experience.

## Core Web Vitals Optimizations

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

LCP measures how quickly the largest content element becomes visible to users.

**Implemented optimizations:**

- Hero image preloading with high priority
- Early background color setting to prevent flash of unstyled content
- Critical CSS inlining for above-the-fold content
- HTTP/2 Server Push for critical assets
- Font preloading with `font-display: swap`
- Optimized image loading with prioritization

### First Input Delay (FID)

FID measures the time from when a user first interacts with a page to the time when the browser can respond to that interaction.

**Implemented optimizations:**

- Breaking up long JavaScript tasks
- Device capability detection for performance budgeting
- Deferred loading of non-critical JavaScript
- Touch optimization for mobile devices
- Reduced animation complexity on mobile

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

CLS measures visual stability by quantifying unexpected layout shifts during page loading.

**Implemented optimizations:**

- Pre-defined aspect ratios for images
- Reserved space for dynamic content
- Height and width attributes on images
- Minimum height containers for dynamic content
- Font preloading to prevent text shifts

## Image Optimizations

- Implemented lazy loading for all below-the-fold images
- Automatic WebP format conversion with fallbacks
- Responsive images with appropriate srcset and sizes
- Optimized image dimensions for different viewports
- Content-visibility optimization for offscreen images

## HTTP/2 Optimizations

- Implemented server push for critical assets
- Configured modulepreload for JavaScript modules
- Optimized request header compression
- Prioritized critical resources

## Caching Strategy

- Immutable caching for static assets (1 year)
- No-cache headers for dynamic HTML content
- Optimized cache headers for different file types
- Preloading of critical resources

## How to Use These Optimizations

### OptimizedImage Component

```astro
<OptimizedImage 
  src="/path/to/image.jpg"
  alt="Descriptive alt text"
  loading="lazy"
  fetchpriority="auto"
  aspectRatio="16/9"
  deferVisibility={true}
/>
```

- Set `fetchpriority="high"` for hero images or LCP candidates
- Set `aspectRatio` to prevent layout shifts
- Enable `deferVisibility` for images far below the fold

### CriticalOptimizations Component

```astro
<CriticalOptimizations 
  priority="high"
  heroImagePath="/path/to/hero-image.webp"
/>
```

- Set `priority="high"` for home pages and landing pages
- Set `priority="low"` for less important pages

### Content Visibility

Add the `data-defer-visibility` attribute to sections that are far below the fold:

```html
<section data-defer-visibility data-height="500px">
  <!-- Content -->
</section>
```

### Dynamic Content Containers

For containers that will have dynamic content loaded, use:

```html
<div class="dynamic-content" data-min-height="300px">
  <!-- Dynamic content will load here -->
</div>
```

## Monitoring Performance

- Regularly test with Google PageSpeed Insights
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
- Use Chrome DevTools Performance panel to identify bottlenecks
- Set up Real User Monitoring (RUM) to track actual user experiences

## Tools Used

- Lighthouse for performance auditing
- Chrome DevTools for performance profiling
- WebPageTest for detailed performance analysis
- HTTP/2 Server Push via Netlify headers
- WebP image optimization
